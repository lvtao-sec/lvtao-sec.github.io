    > Model checking is an approach to exploring states
    in an model abstracted from implementations for checking
    the conformance to the specification/properties.
    Here the model can be in different froms, such as,
    finite state machine with S: states, T: transitions.
    >
    > Due to the need of exploring all states, it faces state explosion.
    Especially in the concurrent systems, the partial orders between
    concurrent transitions make the search space larger.
    To solve this problem,
    previous works proposed **statically** and **dynamically**
    partial order reduction,
    which skips exploring different order os transitions
    which are independent.
