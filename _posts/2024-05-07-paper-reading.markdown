- Direct Memory Translation for Virtualized Clouds
    <details>
    > Instead of translating a virtual memory address to physical address with a multiple-level page walk,
    >
    > DMT directly maps a Virtual Memory Area to a continuous physical memory area with additional hardware registers.
    >
    > Shortcomings:
    >
    > - Applications aggressively allocating memory can lead to fragmented, unused, and waste physical memory.
