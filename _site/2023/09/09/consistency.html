<h1 id="the-essence-of-consistency">The Essence of Consistency</h1>

<p>The concept of consistency has been applied to various domains,
e.g., the shared-memory multiprocessor and
distributed storage/memory systems.
Its <strong>essence</strong> is the defintion of predictable read/write behaviors
in both sequential or concurrent executions.
In other words, it is about the ordering among reads/writes.</p>

<p>We can categorize the consistency concept
according to the read/write object into two kinds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Read/Write on one object</em>:
The data written by which write will be returned to a read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Read/Write on different object</em>:</p>
  </li>
</ul>
